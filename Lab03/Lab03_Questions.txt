Q.1)
Board has a 100MHZ cloc.
I run the picoblaze without a clock divider.
Each operation takes exactly 2 clock cycles for the pico blaze.
Below is the assembly with comments. In total there is 6 lines of code. One of them is a jump that skips one line of code so the shortest operation is 5 lines of code. 
Each line of code translates to one processor operation that takes two clock cycles, so the longest the system will take is 12 clock cycles and the shortest it will take is 10 clock cycles.
At 100MHz, this translates to (100*(10^6))^-1 = 1*10^-8 s per clock cycle, making my code take 1*10^-8s/cycle * 10 cycles = 1*10^-7s to 1*10^-8s/cycle * 12 cycles = 1.2*10^-7s.

main:   INPUT s2, SWITCHES      ; Read switches into s2 register
; check if the switch is pressed, if it is, complement the switch data
; first, load switch vale
	INPUT s3, BUTTON
	COMPARE s3, 00
;then compare it to the inactive value
	JUMP NZ, no_button_pressed
;if the switch is not pressed,
    XOR s2, FF              ; Complement the switch Data
no_button_pressed:
        OUTPUT s2, LEDS         ; Write the Data to the LEDs
        JUMP main               ; Loop Back to top of main'
		
		
operation takes: 1*10^-7s to 1.2*10^-7s to complete.

Q.2)
Using just the assembly instructions there is no way to stop the PicoBlaze from executing instructions. You could do it in hardware using the reset line though.

Q.3)
The main function of the wrapping verilog was to control the input mux and the output mux with enable lines.

Q.4)
There are two forms of OUTPUT in the picoblaze assembly.
case 1: OUTPUT sX, (sY)
	this writes the sX register to the output port pointed to by sY
	PORT_ID = Sy
	OUT_PORT = sX
case 2: OUTPUT sX, pp
	this writes the sX register to the output port pp
	PORT_ID = pp
	OUT_PORT = sX
If there were several banks of outputs recieving the same data, the first case would be useful as you could iterate over each port by incrementing just the sY register.
